# 27B_Heretic_NEO_CODE_IQ3_M — 07_neocode_lru

## Prompt

Implement an LRU (least-recently-used) cache in Python as a class named exactly `LRUCache`, using only the standard library (no third-party dependencies). Match this API and its semantics exactly:

- `LRUCache(capacity: int)` — capacity is >= 1.
- `get(self, key)` -> the stored value, or None if the key is absent. A successful get marks the key as most-recently-used.
- `put(self, key, value)` -> None. Inserts or updates the key and marks it most-recently-used. If inserting a NEW key would exceed capacity, first evict the least-recently-used key.
- `peek(self, key)` -> the stored value, or None if absent. peek MUST NOT change recency — this is the subtle part, and it is the opposite of get.
- `__len__(self)` -> the current number of cached items.

Requirements: `get` and `put` must be O(1) average time.

After the implementation, write unit tests (stdlib `unittest`) that specifically prove: (1) LRU eviction order, (2) that `get` updates recency but `peek` does NOT — i.e. a peeked key is still the one evicted next, (3) that `put` on an existing key refreshes both its value and its recency, and (4) capacity=1 behavior. Finally, state the time and space complexity of each method in one line each.

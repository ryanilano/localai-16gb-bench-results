# 27B_IQ4_XS — 01_semver_compare

## Prompt

Implement a function `compare_versions(a: str, b: str) -> int` that compares two Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 strings. Return -1 if a < b, 0 if equal, 1 if a > b.

You MUST follow the SemVer precedence rules exactly:
- Compare major, minor, patch numerically.
- A version WITH a pre-release tag has LOWER precedence than the same version without one (1.0.0-alpha < 1.0.0).
- Compare pre-release identifiers dot-by-dot: numeric identifiers compared numerically, alphanumeric compared lexically in ASCII order, numeric identifiers always rank lower than alphanumeric ones, and a larger set of fields ranks higher when all preceding ones are equal.
- Build metadata (after '+') is IGNORED in precedence.

Include 6 unit tests that specifically cover: pre-release vs release, numeric vs alphanumeric identifiers (e.g. 1.0.0-alpha.1 vs 1.0.0-alpha.beta), differing field counts (1.0.0-alpha vs 1.0.0-alpha.1), and that build metadata is ignored.
